                Utterly mad, tragically homicidal, and horrifyingly purple, Dr. Mundo is what keeps many of Zaun’s
                citizens indoors on particularly dark nights. Now a self-proclaimed physician, he was once a patient of
                Zaun’s most infamous asylum. After “curing” the entire staff, Dr. Mundo established his practice in the
                empty wards that once treated him and began mimicking the highly unethical procedures he had so often
                experienced himself. With a full cabinet of medicines and zero medical knowledge, he now makes himself
                more monstrous with each injection and terrifies the hapless “patients” who wander near his office.
